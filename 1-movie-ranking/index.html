    <h3>Kraven: The Hunter</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed the movie but the story is okay-ish!</p>

    <h3>Twister 2024</h3>
    <p>It's one of my favorite natural disaster films I like.</p>

    <h3>Venom: The LAst Dance</h3>
    <p>It's the last installment in the film series, I think. Maybe not. But I enjoyed it alot.</p>
